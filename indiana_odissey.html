    <h1 id="scene0"> Iskenderun Train Station </h1>
    <p>In 1938, after discovering the second marker in Venice, Jones sent Marcus Brody ahead to Iskenderun to meet up with Sallah and start the search for the Holy Grail while Jones went with Elsa Schneider to rescue Henry Jones, Sr.. Brody and Sallah met up at the train station, but Brody was kidnapped by Nazi agents, who took the map. Days later, Sallah met up with Jones and his father in the town, and drove them out to the desert, where they spied Walter Donovan's convoy and attempted a rescue.[http://indianajones.wikia.com/]</p>

    <h1 id="scene2"> Rolls Royce scene</h1>
    <p> "Nazi Rolls-Royce Phantom II staff car was used by Walter Donovan in Hatay. When offered "suitable compensation" for removing the Holy Grail from within Hatay's borders, the Sultan balked at the chest of gold valuables and instead expressed interest in Donovan's Rolls-Royce, adding that he even liked the color. Donovan, willing to give up his car if it meant obtaining the Grail, politely told the Sultan the keys were in the ignition.</p>
    <p>In return for the prize automobile, the Sultan promised to provide provisions and troops for the expedition to recover the Grail, including camels, horses, and tanks.[http://indianajones.wikia.com/]</p>
